# Data Analyse Projects on Kaggle Datasets
They are projects I did for a data science and machine learning course.
## Including:
- Use random forest to predict the live or dead for the passengers in the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brendan45774/test-file). And use [AUC/ROC curve](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/06/auc-roc-curve-machine-learning/) to evaluate the result.
- Use seaborn to visualize the data for stocks
- Use linear regression to analyze the correlation of wine quility and the acidity, sugar, so2 percentage for the [wine quality](https://www.kaggle.com/danielpanizzo/wine-quality) dataset.
- Use Tensorflow to train a LSTM model for text translation from English to Chinese.

## Language:
